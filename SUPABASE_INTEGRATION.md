# Supabase Integration Guide

Your decentralized event ticketing platform now includes Supabase integration for improved performance and user experience. This hybrid approach combines blockchain authenticity with database speed.

## üöÄ What's New

### Enhanced Components
- **EventMarketplaceEnhanced**: Loads events from Supabase first (fast), then supplements with blockchain data
- **CreateEventFormEnhanced**: Creates events on blockchain AND caches them in Supabase
- Smart data source indicators show where data is coming from (Supabase, Blockchain, or Mixed)

### Benefits
- ‚ö° **Fast Loading**: Events load instantly from Supabase cache
- üîó **Blockchain Verification**: Critical data still verified on-chain
- üíæ **Offline Resilience**: Events remain accessible even if blockchain is slow
- üîÑ **Automatic Sync**: Events are cached when created and updated when tickets are purchased

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Supabase Database Setup
Run this SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Enable RLS (Row Level Security)
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS tickets ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create events table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS events (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    ticket_price TEXT NOT NULL,
    max_tickets INTEGER NOT NULL,
    sold_tickets INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    organizer TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    date TEXT,
    time TEXT,
    location TEXT,
    image_url TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL
);

-- Create tickets table (optional - for caching user tickets)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tickets (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    event_id TEXT REFERENCES events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    owner TEXT NOT NULL,
    token_id INTEGER,
    is_used BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    purchased_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL,
    used_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_events_organizer ON events(organizer);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_events_created_at ON events(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_events_is_active ON events(is_active);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tickets_owner ON tickets(owner);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tickets_event_id ON tickets(event_id);

-- RLS Policies (adjust based on your needs)
-- Allow public read access to events
CREATE POLICY "Public events are viewable by everyone" ON events
    FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to create events
CREATE POLICY "Users can create events" ON events
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow organizers to update their events
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own events" ON events
    FOR UPDATE USING (true);

-- Tickets policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their tickets" ON tickets
    FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create tickets" ON tickets
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- Sample events for testing
INSERT INTO events (id, name, description, ticket_price, max_tickets, organizer, location, date, time, image_url) VALUES

ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Your `.env.local` already has the Supabase configuration:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 3. How It Works

#### Event Creation Flow
1. User creates event via `CreateEventFormEnhanced`
2. Event is created on Avalanche blockchain (source of truth)
3. Event data is cached in Supabase for fast loading
4. Success feedback shows both steps

#### Event Loading Flow
1. `EventMarketplaceEnhanced` loads events from Supabase first (instant)
2. Simultaneously attempts to load from blockchain
3. Merges data (blockchain takes priority for conflicts)
4. Visual indicators show data source

#### Ticket Purchase Flow
1. Ticket purchased on blockchain
2. Local state updated immediately
3. Supabase cache updated to reflect new sold ticket count

## üéØ Testing the Integration

### 1. Test Event Creation
1. Connect your wallet on Avalanche Fuji
2. Go to "Create Event" tab
3. Fill in event details and submit
4. Watch the progress: "Creating on Blockchain..." ‚Üí "Caching Event Data..." ‚Üí "Event Created Successfully!"
5. Switch to Marketplace to see your event with a "Cache" badge

### 2. Test Fast Loading
1. Refresh the page and go to Marketplace
2. Events should load instantly from Supabase
3. Look for data source badges:
   - üîµ **Supabase**: Data from cache
   - üü¢ **Blockchain**: Data from blockchain
   - üü£ **Mixed**: Combined data sources

### 3. Test Ticket Purchasing
1. Buy a ticket from the marketplace
2. The available ticket count should update immediately
3. Your purchase is recorded on blockchain AND cached count is updated

## üîß Customization Options

### Disable Supabase (Blockchain Only)
If you want to use blockchain-only mode, simply don't run the Supabase setup or remove the environment variables. The enhanced components will gracefully fallback to blockchain-only operation.

### Extend Supabase Schema
You can add more fields to the events table for additional features:
```sql
-- Add more event metadata
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN category TEXT;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN external_url TEXT;
```

### Custom Caching Logic
Modify the `lib/supabase.ts` file to implement custom caching strategies, like:
- Time-based cache invalidation
- User-specific event filtering
- Advanced search capabilities

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Blockchain is Source of Truth**: Supabase is used for performance, but blockchain data always takes priority
2. **RLS Policies**: Adjust the Row Level Security policies based on your security requirements
3. **Error Handling**: The system gracefully handles Supabase failures and falls back to blockchain-only mode
4. **Data Consistency**: Critical operations (payments, ownership) always go through blockchain

## üìä Monitoring

Watch the browser console for integration logs:
- "Loading events from Supabase..."
- "Added X events from blockchain"
- "Event X cached in Supabase successfully"

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. Run the Supabase SQL script
2. Test the enhanced marketplace and event creation
3. Monitor performance improvements
4. Optionally extend with more Supabase features like real-time subscriptions
5. Consider implementing user-specific caching for tickets

Your platform now offers the best of both worlds: blockchain security with database performance! üöÄ
